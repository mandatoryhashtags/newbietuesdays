**In Attendance**: Matt (host), Matt, Chris, Tom, Nathan (presenter)

**Notes**: Nathan stepped us through a module that included a custom controller, form submission, admin grid, and install script.  It was a deep dive with lots of insights, practical applications, and interesting conversations.  The meeting was from 5:30 - 9:30, our longest ever, also our most educational.  There was little about the next exercise.  We decided to build a module together next time. Also, Matt's wife made delicious cookies.
